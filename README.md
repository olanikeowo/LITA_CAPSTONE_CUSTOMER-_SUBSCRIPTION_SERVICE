## LITA_CAPSTONE_CUSTOMER-_SUBSCRIPTION_SERVICE
This is where i documented my second project while learning data analysis with the Incubator Hub.
### PROJECT TITLE:Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service.
---
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
     This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, 
    and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI dashboard that presents your analysis.
    This is an analysis of the Sales performance of a Retail Store. It is done by analyzing data using Pivot table from Capstone Dataset which includes,
    Sales table and Customer table. Also, different queries were executed from the database using SQL and thereafter,imported into PowerBI 
    where the actual analysis was carried out in order to discover 
    the key insights such as the top selling products,Regional performance and Monthly Sales trends.

### DATA SOURCES
    The Data used for this project work is gotten from Capstone.The primary source of the Data is Data CSV and it is an open source Data that can be freely 
    downloaded from Kaggle or any other Data repository site.

### TOOL USED
-Microsoft Excel :
  - For Data Cleaning
  - For Analyzing
  - For Data Visualization
- SQL : Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- PowerBI:
  - For Data Modelling
  - For Data Visualization
  - Creating Key Performance Indicators(KPIs)
  - Using DAX Function to perform basic measures
  - Github for portfolio building.
---
 ### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
  In the initial of the Data cleaning and preparation, the following actions were performed;
   - Data loading and inspection
   - Using Excel function to calculate the Total Sales on sales Data and also Average subcription duration on customer Data.
   - Data cleaning and formatting.

###  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
1. Excel:
  - Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
  - Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular 
subscription types.
  -Create any other interesting reports.
2. SQL:
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions. 
- retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
- find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
- find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
- calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
- find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
- calculate total revenue by subscription type.
- find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
- find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
3. Power BI: Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends. Include slicers for interactive analysis.

### DATA ANALYSIS
 This is where i used pivot tables to calculate the Total Sales for each category of products, Region,Month and other interesting reports were created.

 The Sales Table and Customer Tables were imported into SQL Management Studio were some queries were executed in order to get some ananlysis.

These tables were then imported into PowerBI desktop for analysis.I transformed the Data in Power Query,checked for column quality,distribution, profile and Data types.

  Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at a desired KPI or metrics. which are:
  - Top-Selling Products
  - Regional Performance 
  - Monthly Sales Trends and
  - insights Analysis

### DATA MODELLING
 Tables were automatically joined together by creating relationship with them, PowerBI does this intelligently.To get specific insights and 
information,i had to create other relationship and measures.
